# Chirper Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

## Project Setup

* clone the Project - `git@github.com:udacity/reactnd-chirper-app.git`
* install the dependencies - `npm install`

## The Importance of Planning Your Project
Many developers make the mistake of starting to code before they've put any thought into figuring out precisely what their app's architecture should be. This approach results in spending an incredible amount of time debugging, restructuring the code, and sometimes even starting over, completely!

Trust us, planning out your project before starting to code will save you a lot of time later on.

In our Chirper project walkthrough, we'll go over the planning stages as well as the coding stages of the project.

Planning Your React/Redux App's Architecture
In the Planning Stage, we will go over 4 steps that will help you come up with your app's architecture, which is often the trickiest part.

A Guide for the Planning Stages of Your Project
1. Identify What Each View Should Look Like
2. Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components
3. Determine What Events Happen in the App
4. Determine What Data Lives in the Store

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.
